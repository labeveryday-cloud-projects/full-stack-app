Running the Demo
Start the FastAPI server.
Open the HTML file in a web browser.
Enter a URL and click submit to see the processed result.
Notes
The backend code is a basic example and doesn't include error handling for different content types or unavailable URLs.
For text extraction from complex documents like PDFs, additional libraries (e.g., PyPDF2 for PDFs) and logic are needed.
The frontend is a basic HTML/JavaScript form without styling or advanced features.
Remember to replace the placeholder logic with actual LLM integration when you have your API key and setup ready.
This demo provides a foundational structure that you can build upon and modify according to your specific requirements and use cases.
